### Image Generation Prompt

A visually stunning, minimalist graphic displaying the number series: **2, 4, 12, 16, 80, ?** The numbers must be rendered in objective type typography (geometric sans-serif, high contrast). Use an engaging deep purple and electric lime background that suggests digital flow and complex circuitry. The composition should highlight the question mark with a subtle glow, implying a solution is hidden. The overall image must be extremely sharp, highly detailed (4K quality), and feature a distinct 'Pulse Vector' watermark integrated professionally into the bottom corner. Focus on logical tension and geometric precision.
