A professional high-definition educational graphic for a digital brain teaser. The layout is in a clean, objective format with a centered focus. The background is a sophisticated solid deep charcoal gray with a subtle, glowing neon-blue vector pulse wave running horizontally at the bottom. The central text features the sequence "2, 6, 15, 31, 56, ?" in bold, sharp white 3D typography. Below the sequence, the four options (a. 81, b. 92, c. 87, d. 104) are neatly organized in a 2x2 grid with high-contrast borders. 4k resolution, hyper-detailed, cinematic lighting, sharp edges, and a minimalist "pulse-vector" watermark positioned elegantly in the bottom-right corner.
