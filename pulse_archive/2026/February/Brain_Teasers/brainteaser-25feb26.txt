**Image Generation Prompt:**
A high-quality 4k educational graphic designed for a digital screen. The background is a solid, deep charcoal gray with faint, elegant neon-blue geometric "pulse" lines flowing horizontally. The text is centered and ultra-sharp, featuring the sequence "3, 7, 15, 31, 63, ?" in a modern sans-serif bold font. Below the sequence, the four options (a. 125, b. 127, c. 128, d. 131) are neatly arranged in a 2x2 grid format. The overall aesthetic is professional, clean, and engaging. A small, sophisticated 'pulse-vector' watermark is placed discretely in the bottom right corner. Cinematic lighting, high contrast, and crisp edges.
