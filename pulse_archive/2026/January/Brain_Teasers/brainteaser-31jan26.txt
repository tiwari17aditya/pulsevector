### Image Generation Prompt

A visually striking 4K quality rendering of a futuristic objective screen displaying the series question '5, 12, 10, 17, 15, 22, ?' and its four multiple-choice answers (a. 25, b. 29, c. 20, d. 18). Extremely sharp details and high contrast, set against a solid deep sapphire blue background accented with subtle, glowing neon geometric vector lines representing abstract logical flow. The overall aesthetic is sleek, digital, and high-tech. The sequence itself should be highlighted with subtle energy trails. Include a visible 'pulse-vector' logo watermark integrated into the bottom right corner of the visual interface. Minimalist design, focused on readability.
